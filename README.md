POPULATION CHANGE DASHBOARD



A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF POPULATION CHANGES IN THE TOP 12 RICHEST COUNTRIES IN EUROPE

A population is deÔ¨Åned as a group of individuals of the same species living and interbreeding within a given area. According to Wikipedia, population refers to the number of people in a single area, whether it be a city or town, region, country, continent, or the world. Members of a population often rely on the same resources, are subject to similar environmental constraints, and depend on the availability of other members to persist over time
Demographic data can include any statistical factors that influence population growth or decline but several parameters are particularly important: population size, migration, age structure, birth rates, death rates, and sex ratio (Dodge 2006).

The following parameters are the focus of action in this report analysis: -

To compare the population demographic (birth rate, death rate, migration) of the selected 12 richest European Countries

To determine population changes in the last ten years (2010-2022)

To recommend how the challenges of the changes in population can be resolved based on the insight gathered from the dataset.

The 12 Europian countries studied are below

From the dashboard fig, 1 and 2 above, we have the total population of all the countries 7.2 million, total birthrate, total death rate and total migration. The dashboard also shows the visual of the birthrate, birthrate, migration of the selected countries for the year 2010 to 2022. From the visuals, It shows Russian has the highest population while Norway is with the least value. Also, the visual for Russian has the highest value of death, birth and migration rate while Norway has the lowest rates.
The above figure shows the time trend of the life expectancy, migration, death and birth over the year from 2010 to 2022. This shows in the year 2010 there was highest record of birth and it decrease drastically the year 2022. For birth rate, there was a low record in the year 2010 but in the year 2013, lowest rate was recorded while in the highest rate was recorded for year 2022

Figure 3 above is the dashboard display of the visuals for birthrate, birthrate, migration of the selected countries for the year 2010. The total population of all the countries for year 2010 is 544.35K. From the visuals, Russian has the highest value of death and birth rate while Norway has the lowest rates. UK has the highest rate of migration while Poland has the lowest rate of migration.


CONCLUSION

From the insights are generated and gathered, we can conclude Russian Federation had the highest death rate and was 4,704.53% higher than Norway, which had the lowest deaths rate at 534.20

2019 had the highest Life expectancy value and was 2.21% higher than 2010, which had the lowest Life expectancy value at 957.47

Across all 12 Country or Area, Russian Federation has the highest death rate as it accounted for 32.95% of death rate.

Across all 13 Year(s), Life expectancy value ranged from 957.47 to 978.62

Migration rate increased drastically in the year 2022, and Poland had the highest record of migration followed.
